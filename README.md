# Bird Strike Data Visualization (2000-2011)

## Overview
This project aims to visualize bird strike data collected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) between 2000 and 2011. Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aircraft safety, and understanding the patterns and trends in bird strikes can help in implementing preventive measures.

## Problem Statement
Bird strikes are a common occurrence and can lead to significant damage to aircraft, sometimes resulting in fatal accidents. This project seeks to visually analyze bird strike data to identify patterns and factors contributing to bird strikes, particularly during critical phases of flight.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and contains records of bird strikes reported between 2000 and 2011. It includes information such as the location, time, type of aircraft, and severity of the bird strike incidents.

## Methodology
1. Data Loading: Loading the bird strike dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for visualization.
3. Data Visualization: Visualizing bird strike incidents using various plots and charts to identify patterns and trends.
4. Interpretation: Analyzing the visualizations to gain insights into bird strike occurrences and factors influencing them.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo


3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

4. Open and run the `Data_Visualization_of_bird_strikes_bw_2000_2011.ipynb` notebook.

## Visualizations
- Line plots showing the trend of bird strikes over the years.
- Bar charts depicting the distribution of bird strikes by location, aircraft type, and severity.
- Heatmaps illustrating the frequency of bird strikes in different regions.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating geographic visualization techniques to map bird strike incidents.
- Analyzing the impact of environmental factors on bird strike occurrences.
- Building predictive models to forecast bird strike risk in specific areas.
